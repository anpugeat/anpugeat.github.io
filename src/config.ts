  aboutMe:
    "Hi there! You've probably seen my CV already. This is just a little more about me. \n\n I'm an eager STEM graduate from a globally-diverse "+
    "background, having studied at international hubs like Beijing, Hong Kong and London. "+
    
    "Upon completing my degrees, I had recalled a thorough enjoyment out of completing a variety of data analysis, coding and machine learning modules. "+
    "I found myself self-learning a number of Data Science and ML modules from both UCL's MSc Data Science and ML course as well as accredited "+
    "teaching programs like Coursera. I've confirmed now that, for my career, Data Science is what I want to do. I am excited for the chance at a role in "+
    "this field and to dedicate myself fully towards it. "+
    "This website offers a bit more insight into who I am - I hope you will find that I am a good fit for your company!"
